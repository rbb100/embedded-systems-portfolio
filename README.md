# Embedded Systems Portfolio – Rahul Biju

## About Me
I am a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University with prior industry experience in embedded ECU validation and system testing.

While my professional roles were validation-focused, I actively worked on hands-on projects to strengthen my skills in embedded systems, digital design, and telecom software. This portfolio showcases those projects and reflects my transition toward deeper development-oriented roles.

## Portfolio Overview

This repository contains three focused projects demonstrating my exposure across:
- Embedded Linux & hardware–software integration
- Digital logic design and verification
- Telecom systems and automation using Python

Each project includes documentation explaining the goal, implementation, and key learnings.

## What This Portfolio Represents
This portfolio represents my effort to complement validation-heavy industry experience with practical, hands-on work in embedded systems, digital hardware, and telecom software.  

The projects are intentionally scoped to demonstrate fundamentals, debugging mindset, and system-level understanding rather than production-scale solutions.
